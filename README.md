## Introduction
In this repository, we used various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. In the dataset-scaled features, the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons.

## Goals 
1. Understand the distribution of the data that was provided to us.
2. Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of "fraud" and "non-fraud" transactions.
3. Determine the Classifiers that help decide which one has higher accuracy.
4. Create a neural network to compare the accuracy of the best Classifier.
5. Understand the common mistakes made with imbalanced datasets since the number of either fraudulent transactions or non-fraudulent transactions are way more higher than the other which makes the predictive model biased towards the one class of data (maybe fraudulent or non-fraudulent transactions) since the class distribution is uneven.
